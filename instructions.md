# Filter Selector

This project aims to demonstrate mainly the application of filters using the OpenCV library, coupled with this, this project has a dashboard entirely built using the Streamlit library. Additionally, this is not a simple dashboard, but one that is running on Stramlit's newest tool, [Streamlit Sharing](https://streamlit.io/sharing).

To access the result of this application, just click the button below:

How this wonderful tool works is in my article on Medium.
